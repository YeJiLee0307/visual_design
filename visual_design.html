  <h2>✦ Visual Design – Student Council Promotion</h2>

  <p>
    This visual series was designed as part of the promotion and communication efforts for the Student Council of the College of Knowledge Convergence Media.
    The key design objective was to deliver clear and accessible information to students while maintaining a cohesive and recognizable visual identity for the student council. 
    Each layout was carefully structured to prioritize readability—through consistent use of typographic hierarchy, generous spacing, and clean graphical elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build a sense of unity across all materials, I used the official council color: purple. The palette ranges from soft lavender to deep violet tones, 
    creating a calm and dependable impression while staying consistent with the student body’s identity. Subtle gradients and textures were added to avoid flatness and to reflect the layered and evolving nature of campus life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each graphic was designed to suit a specific function—event announcements, recruitment calls, academic guides—and yet the entire set forms a cohesive system.
    Icons and illustrations were custom-designed to match the geometric and minimal style, supporting the content without overwhelming it.
  </p>
  <p>
    By maintaining design consistency and visual clarity, these materials helped the student council strengthen its brand presence and build trust with the student community.

    <p>
      This calendar was created for the incoming Class of 2025, offering both a practical schedule tool and a visually engaging introduction to campus life.
      The design concept was based on minimal geometric shapes, used to abstractly express the rhythm and atmosphere of each month. Rather than relying on overly decorative elements, 
      I focused on visual clarity and seasonal mood, capturing the essence of time through restrained yet expressive forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each month includes a campus photo that reflects the seasonal landscape, helping new students feel more emotionally connected to the university. 
      For example, October features a warm-toned photograph of Sogang’s iconic fall foliage—an image many students will recognize and remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September’s layout, I used a simple horizontal grid to visualize weekly flow, with color highlights on weekends to guide the user’s attention. 
      The integration of typography and structure emphasizes functionality while keeping a clean and modern tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project reflects my approach to design that balances clarity, emotional resonance, and brand identity—creating not just a useful tool, but an experience of orientation and belonging.
